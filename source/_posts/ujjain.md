City is in a spiritual high. Streets are filled with holy chants and ghats are filled with an intense aroma of chillam smoked by babas who share a bond beyond blood beyond any worldly desires. Endless parade of pilgrims have visited the Holy river to take a dip and strengthen their faith and quench spiritual thirst. I also took a leap of faith and somehow managed to reach the
ghat fighting intense heat and crowd of people coming from distant unknown places. Its a wonder how perspective changes, same places I avoided visiting in childhood are now a nostalgic amusement.
